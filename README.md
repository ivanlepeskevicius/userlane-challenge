# userlane-challenge

Cypress challenge: 

Visit the Userlane career page and check if any QA position is open and then apply for the position.
Make to use of the cypress network request feature to check for a successful response from the backend when the application is submitted.


Usage: 
make sure you have yarn installed in your computer, you can check it with the following command: 
> yarn --version 

If no version is found, you can run this command to install it (npm is also required): 
> npm install --global yarn

Run 'yarn install' in order to install all the dependencies needed to run the tests. 
Once all the dependencies were downloaded, you can use the following commands to run the tests: 

> yarn cypress run

This will run the tests in headless mode and you can watch the video recordings once it finishes. 

> yarn cypress open 

This will open the Cypress UI, from there you can select which test want to run and see the execution in real-time.
